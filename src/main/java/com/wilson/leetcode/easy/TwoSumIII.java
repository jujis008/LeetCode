 * https://www.programcreek.com/2014/03/two-sum-iii-data-structure-design-java/
 *
 * Design and implement a TwoSum class. It should support the following operations: add and find.
 *
 * add - Add the number to an internal data structure.
 * find - Find if there exists any pair of numbers which sum is equal to the value.
 *
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * add(1);
 * add(3);
 * add(5);
 * find(4) -> true
 * find(7) -> false
 * Java Solution
 *
 * Since the desired class need add and get operations, HashMap is a good option for this purpose.
